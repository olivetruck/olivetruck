- 👋 Hi, I’m @olivetruck
- :octocat: I graduated in 2020 with a degree in Engineering.
- 📖 I have started this GitHub to track and list my attempt to self-teach(self-learn?) Computer Science.
- 🍓This provides a space for myself to stay accountable and for others to use as a guide.
- ⭐ Onwards and upwards.
